# QUARKUS-4221 Productization of Picocli extension

JIRA: https://issues.redhat.com/browse/QUARKUS-4221

PR: https://github.com/quarkus-qe/quarkus-test-suite/pull/2003
## Scope of the testing
### What to test

The test coverage will be verified for environments: JVM for Baremetal.

 It won't be tested on Native because this support was requested by the Keycloak team, and they explicitly stated (in the comments of the Jira task) that they don't work with native executables,
so it's not needed at the moment.

Openshift excluded due to the impracticality of running command-line applications with CLI arguments in these environment.

### Scenarios
* Verify command line application with some annotations such as: `@CommandLine.Command` / `@CommandLine.Option` 

  - **Purpose:** Ensure that the greeting command works correctly and produces the expected output when provided with the correct arguments.
  - **Configuration:** Set up a @QuarkusApplication RestService to run the application in a controlled environment.
  - **Test:** Run the command and verify that the output matches the expected greeting message.
  

* Verify the usage of proxy scope with @ApplicationScope in beans to check 'Picocli will not be able to set field values in such beans' according 
the warning in the guide: [simple-command-line-application](https://quarkus.io/guides/picocli#simple-command-line-application).

  - **Purpose:** To test if Picocli can handle beans annotated with `@ApplicationScoped`. 
  According to Picocli documentation, `@ApplicationScoped` beans should not be used with Picocli commands
  because Picocli cannot set field values in such beans due to their proxy nature. 
  This scenario will confirm if the use of @ApplicationScoped with Picocli produces an error or warning.
  - **Configuration:** Create and configure a Picocli command (AgeCommand) annotated with `@ApplicationScoped`. 
  Set up a REST service to execute this command with an age argument.
  - **Test:**  Run the command and verify that the logs contain an error or
  warning message indicating that `@ApplicationScoped` is not compatible with Picocli commands,
  as Picocli cannot set field values in such beans.
  
  
* Verify Handling of Blank and Invalid Arguments

  - **Purpose:** Test the application's response to missing or incorrect arguments for the greeting command.
  - **Configuration:**  Set up REST services with configurations that include blank or invalid arguments for the greeting command.
  - **Test:**  Run the greeting command with these arguments and verify that the application produces appropriate error messages.

  
* Verify command line application with multiple Commands
  - **Purpose:**  Test the behavior of a command-line application with multiple commands using `@TopCommand` and ensure it functions correctly.
  Additionally, verify that if multiple `@CommandLine.Command` annotations are used without `@TopCommand`, it should fail.
  - **Configuration:**
    Set up a Picocli command (EntryCommand) annotated with `@TopCommand`, which includes multiple subcommands (e.g., GreetingCommand, AgeCommand).
    Set up another scenario where multiple `@CommandLine.Command` annotations are present but without the `@TopCommand`.
  - **Test:**
    With `@TopCommand`: Run the command and verify that both commands (e.g., greeting and age) execute successfully as subcommands under EntryCommand.
    Without `@TopCommand`: Run the commands without `@TopCommand` and verify that the application fails to recognize the commands, leading to an error
  indicating that the top command is missing.
  
  
* Verify the functionality of PicocliCommandLineFactory in order to customize Picocli CommandLine instance.
  - **Purpose:**  Test the functionality of PicocliCommandLineFactory to ensure that CommandLine instances are properly customized and that the application 
  behaves as expected with a customized command-line parser.
  - **Configuration:**
    Set up a PicocliCommandLineFactory to produce a customized CommandLine instance.
    Ensure that the factory configures the command with a unique behavior, such as a custom command name or argument parsing logic.
  - **Test:**
    Run the command that relies on the customized CommandLine instance produced by PicocliCommandLineFactory.
    Verify that the command behaves according to the custom configuration (e.g., a specific output or argument handling).
    Ensure that the command output matches the expected customized response (e.g., "CustomizedName").
  
  
* Verify conditional inclusion of commands based on build-time profiles using @IfBuildProfile

  - **Purpose:** Ensure that commands are included or excluded based on the active build-time profile (dev or prod), and that the application behaves correctly when built and run with each profile.
  - **Configuration:**
    Create a configuration class with methods producing @TopCommand beans for dev and prod profiles using `@IfBuildProfile`.
    Implement EntryCommand for the dev profile and OtherEntryCommand for the prod profile.
    Use `@QuarkusApplication` and `RestService` to run the application.
  - **Test:**
     With prod profile:
    Build the application with `mvn clean verify -Dquarkus.profile=prod`.
    Enable the test class (e.g., remove @Disabled annotation).
    Run the application and verify that OtherEntryCommand is available and functions correctly.
    Note: The test for the prod profile is disabled by default because it requires building the application with the prod profile.


### Impact on testsuites and testing automation:
   New tests will be created in a new module quarkus-picocli.

### Impact on resources:
  After the new test classes introduced in quarkus-picocli on JVM will be increased 6.381 seconds.

## Getting familiar with the feature

Following actions were taken to ensure familiarity:
- Experiment with Quarkus Picocli extension functionalities
- Take a look and understand the Quarkus Picocli [Command Mode with Picocli](https://quarkus.io/guides/picocli) related to.
- Ensure documentation provides clear explanation on configuration options.
- Ensure good user experience and simplicity of use.
