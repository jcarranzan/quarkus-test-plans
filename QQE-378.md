## Scope of the testing with Brotli4J
Within the Quarkus framework, we have the option to leverage various compression strategies, including Gzip, Snappy, and Brotli4j.
Notably, Brotli4J, being a part of Vert.x, is inherently supported by Quarkus.

Given the absence of existing test coverage for Brotli4J within this context,
we have identified a need to encompass this area within our testing scope.
- Test whether Brotli4J compression library functions correctly within Quarkus, particularly in the context of REST endpoints using the Quarkus REST extension.
- The test coverage will be verified for JVM, native mode, dev mode and Openshift.
- To use Brotli4J in quarkus compression we will need:
    * Utilize Vert.x http server options  to add Brotli4J compressor support.
    * Ensure that the server is configured to respect the Accept-Encoding header of `br` to automatically
      compress the response body with Brotli4j compression and send it back to the client.
### Brotli4J Test scenarios

- Compression Enabled, Response Compressed and Decompressed
    *    Set up a Quarkus application with the Brotli4J compression library.
    *    Enable quarkus http configuration compression `quarkus.http.enable-compression=true`.
    *    The response is compressed if the Content-Type header is set and the value is a compressed media type as configured specification in the next point.
    *    Specify the media types supported to compress `quarkus.http.compress-media-types`.
    *    Note that the REST extension also make it possible to enable/disable compression declaratively using the annotations `io.quarkus.vertx.http.Compressed` and `io.quarkus.vertx.http.UnCompressed`.
    *    Add the Brotli compressor using `.addCompressor(io.netty.handler.codec.compression.StandardCompressionOptions.brotli())`.
    *    Send a request to a REST endpoint with the `.header("Accept-Encoding", "br")` and verify that the response is compressed using Brotli.
    *    Verify for decompression, that we can use `quarkus.http.enable-decompression` when is it enabled, vert.x will decompress the request’s body if it’s compressed.
- Compression Disabled, Response Not Compressed (Uncompressed)
    *   Disable quarkus http configuration compression `quarkus.http.enable-compression=false`.
    *   Send a request to a REST endpoint and verify that the response is not compressed.
    *   The resource method is never compressed if is annotated with `@io.quarkus.vertx.http.Uncompressed`.
- JSON Payloads, Compression Works up to 8192 bytes
    *   Create a JSON payload of varying sizes up to 8192 bytes.
    *   Send a request to a REST endpoint with the JSON payload and verify that the response is compressed
        using Brotli.
    * Create a JSON payload of more of 8192 bytes and check the error.
-  Different Media Types, Compression Applied Correctly
    *   Create a plain text payload.
    *   Create an XML payload.
    *   Send a request to a REST endpoint with each payload and verify that the response is compressed using Brotli4J.
- Dev Mode
    * Check that the application and tests work properly with @DevModeQuarkusApplication
- Native Mode
    * Verify that the tests are executed and pass with the Native profile.


### Scope of the testing with Snappy

Snappy can be used for message compression in Apache Kafka on outgoing channels. It works on both JVM and Native environments by configuring the application.properties file as follows:

```
mp.messaging.outgoing.${name.of.topic}.compression.type=snappy
quarkus.kafka.snappy.enabled=true
```
Checking compression in Kafka is not straightforward because you configure producers with the compression.type property to compress records written to Kafka.
These records are stored compressed in the broker. When consumers read these records, the compression type is automatically detected and decompressed.
To verify that compression is enabled or being used, you need to examine the Kafka Docker container logs.
In our case, this involves looking at the Strimzi Kafka container logs for the topic "test".
The test coverage will be verified for JVM, native mode, dev mode and Openshift.

### Snappy Test scenarios

- Compression enable
    * Check that compression key in the Kafka logs (compresscodec) has got snappy value.
    * Measure and verify the size of the compressed message bytes to ensure compression has occurred.
    * Verify integrity of message when the consumer read from kafka after decompression that occurs internally.

- JSON payload
    * Send a big json payload to Kafka and check that Snappy compression works properly.
    * Compare the size of the compressed payload with the original to ensure compression efficiency.
- Dev Mode
    * Check that the application and tests works properly with @DevModeQuarkusApplication.
- Native Mode
    * Verify that the tests are executed and pass with the Native profile.
- Openshift scenario.
    * Verify that the tests are executed and pass on Openshift.
